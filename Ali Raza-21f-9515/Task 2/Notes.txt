My Notes on what I will be testing on Metabase Login Feature

Equivalence Partitioning (ECP):

Divide the input space into different equivalence classes to ensure that you test various representative scenarios. For the login feature, these classes could be:
Valid User Credentials (E.g., correct username and password).
Invalid User Credentials (E.g., incorrect username or password).
Empty Fields (i.e., both username and password fields are empty).
Username or Password field individually empty.
Special Characters in the username or password.
Very Long Username and Password.


Boundary Value Analysis (BVA):

Focus on the boundaries of the input space. In the context of login, you should consider:
The minimum and maximum allowable lengths for usernames and passwords.
Test for the shortest and longest valid inputs.
Test for values immediately below and above the minimum and maximum limits.


- Risk Analysis: 

Test for common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and brute-force attacks.
Data Protection Risks: Ensure that user credentials are securely stored and transmitted (e.g., using encryption).
Usability Risks: Test for user-friendly error messages and ensure that users are guided appropriately when login fails.


Other Test Scenarios, Apart from ECP and BVA, I am considering additional scenarios such as:

Testing for multiple failed login attempts and checking if the account is locked after a certain number of failed attempts.
Testing the "Remember Me" feature.
Testing the "Forgot Password" functionality.
Testing the session management after successful login.

-Exploratory Testing:

Perform exploratory testing by using the application as an end-user, trying different inputs and sequences. This approach can uncover unexpected issues.

-Positive and Negative Testing:

Test with valid credentials to ensure successful login.
Test with invalid credentials to ensure proper error handling.

-Multi-User Testing:

Simulate multiple users logging in simultaneously to assess system performance under load.

-Usability Testing:

Evaluate the user-friendliness of the login process, including the clarity of error messages and the overall user experience.
